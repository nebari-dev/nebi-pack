Pages live in `src/content/docs/`. Each `.md` or `.mdx` file becomes a page. The sidebar is configured in `astro.config.mjs` under `starlight.sidebar`.

## CI

The [`docs` workflow](../.github/workflows/docs.yml) builds the site and deploys to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) on every push to `main`. Pull requests get a preview URL posted as a comment.
